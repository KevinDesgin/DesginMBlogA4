Assignment 1: VIdeo Edits
How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?

THe way I visualised this was that I wanted the video to be in pace with the mudic. With every long sound being represented with a fade to black that would transition to the next scene and every change in chords being a cut to a change within the scene. So I ended up choosing the song "memorie" since it was mostly build up with chords and the song fitting the idea of the video being about these memories of me growing up.

How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

I had a lot of stuggles with finding footages at first since I was to focus on narrowing down which items I wanted to shoot. However I deviated from it as I realised that most of the items that I footage was just sitting around inside my house. And so I took a bunch of groups ot different items with different composition. 

What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?

At the beginning, I knew that the music choice was a prime objective that was needed to enhance the audience's experience. It enables audience to hear the audio that would immerse my audince into the video. 
With sound, it create a sense of definition to an items or actions. So I mostly apllied this rule within the first 10 seconds of my video. This created more life to my video that allowed the audince to get a better grasp of the scene. 

How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?



Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

ASsignment 2: Icons 
How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?

Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?

How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?

Assignment 3
How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?

How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?

What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?

How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?

What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

In my desgin, I originally wanted the color shceme to be built off of a monochromatic blue pallet scheme. However I added a little bit more color at the top of the page to give it this calming effect of transitioning  between sunset to night time.  I also wanted to make boaders for each section that would scroll with the page. Giving it a more visual look to the website. This achieve with the help of learning how to ultilise sticky web.

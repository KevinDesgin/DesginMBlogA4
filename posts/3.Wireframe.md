When designing my webpage, I drew up a rough sketch of what I wanted to design my page to appear. Within this sketch, I thought that I would be able to animate the following scene. However due to the assignment bieng single page scroll, most of the animation aspect were scrapped out of the final composition and was replace with me figuring out how to use sticky scroll.

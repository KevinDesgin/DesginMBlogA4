When realising a draft of my webpage, a classmate came up to give feedbacks on how I could improve my webpage.
 1.There needs to be onsistency in the text size and font
 2.There needed a bit more color to pop up the web page 
 3.When viewing the page, some objects could not be seen within the page screen
 4.Reduce the amount of text and add more image to make the web more pleasing to read
 5.Check for little spelling errors

With these feedback, I adjusted my desgin according to these feedback within this video below.
